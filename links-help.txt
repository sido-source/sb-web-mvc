Excellent practical curiosity. Let’s clarify **how a Rest client (e.g. RestTemplate) connects to other servers** step by step:

---

## ✅ **1. Client-Server principle**

When you use `RestTemplate` in your Spring Boot app:

```java
String response = restTemplate.getForObject("http://other-server:8080/api", String.class);
```

🔷 Your **app is the client**, initiating an **outbound HTTP request** to `other-server`.

---

### 💡 **2. Do you need to tell the other server your IP?**

🔴 **No**, under normal circumstances.

Here’s why:

✅ The **HTTP request packet** sent from your app’s machine includes:

* The **destination IP** (e.g. `10.0.1.12`)
* The **source IP** (your server’s IP) as part of TCP/IP networking

But:

🔷 **You do not manually specify your own IP** in the code. The operating system **routes the packet** via your server’s network interface to the destination server.

---

### 🔧 **3. What does the destination server see?**

When the other server receives the request, it sees:

* The **source IP** (your server’s IP), automatically included in the TCP/IP header
* **Request headers** (e.g. Host, User-Agent)
* Any **custom headers** you add (e.g. Authorization)

---

### 🔒 **4. When does source IP matter?**

✅ If the other server:

* Has **firewall rules** allowing only certain IPs → you must ensure your server’s IP is whitelisted
* Uses **mutual TLS (mTLS)** → both sides authenticate each other using certificates

Otherwise:

🔷 For basic HTTP calls, **your IP is automatically used as the source**, no extra config needed.

---

### ⚠️ **5. Exceptions – when you need to configure outgoing IPs**

If your infrastructure has:

🔴 **Multiple network interfaces (ENIs)** or

🔴 **NAT gateways (e.g. in AWS)**

Then:

✅ Outgoing traffic may be routed via:

* A NAT Gateway public IP
* Specific network interface
* A load balancer (reverse proxy) if configured

You **control this via server/network config**, not via RestTemplate.

---

### 💡 **6. Analogy**

Think of your Spring Boot app as your laptop:

* When you open a browser and visit `google.com`, you **don’t specify your own IP** – your router and ISP handle it.

Similarly, your app **initiates the request**, and networking layers handle source IP routing automatically.

---

### 🔧 **7. In Kubernetes (advanced note)**

If your microservice is in Kubernetes:

* Outgoing calls typically use the **node’s IP or NAT gateway IP**
* To force a specific IP, you’d configure **egress rules, dedicated ENIs, or service meshes (e.g. Istio)**

---

## ✅ **8. Summary**

✔️ **RestTemplate only needs the destination URL**
✔️ Your **server’s IP is used automatically** as source, handled by OS/network stack
✔️ Only care about your source IP if:

* Destination firewall restricts incoming IPs
* You need a fixed outbound IP (e.g. for external SaaS whitelisting)

---

If you want, I can explain:

* How this works **within cloud VPCs** (AWS, Azure)
* How **service discovery (Eureka, Consul)** integrates to resolve internal hostnames without hardcoded IPs
